Hello my family. There are five of us my parents, my elder brother, my baby sister and me. Fi-
rst, meet my mum and dad, Jane and Michael. My mum hates reading and my dad enjoys playing
chess with my brother Ken. My mum is slim and rather tall. She has long red hair and big bro-
wn eyes. She has a very pleasant smile and a soft voice. My father is very kind and understa-
nding. We are real friends. She is a housewife. As she has three children, she is always busy around the house. 
She takes care of my baby sister Meg, who is only three months old. Her sister is very small and funny. 
She sleeps, eats and sometimes cries. We all help our mother and let her have a rest in the evening. 
Then she usually reads a book or just watches TV. My father is a doctor. He is tall and handsome.
